# Automated Distributed Public Library System (ADPLS) - Project Skeleton

## Week 0 - Initial repo skeleton
This folder contains a starter skeleton to get the team working immediately.

Structure:
- backend/branchA - Flask server for Branch A
- backend/branchB - Flask server for Branch B
- central-directory - central coordination service
- frontend - simple web UI placeholder
- db - SQL schema + seed script
- docs - project docs (diagrams, proposal, etc)

## Next steps (Week 0 tasks)
1. Create a GitHub repository and push this folder.
2. Set up branch strategy: `main`, `dev`, and `feature/*` branches.
3. Each member picks a system user and updates `docs/contributions.md` with names and responsibilities.
4. Run the skeleton Flask server for Branch A to ensure environment works.
